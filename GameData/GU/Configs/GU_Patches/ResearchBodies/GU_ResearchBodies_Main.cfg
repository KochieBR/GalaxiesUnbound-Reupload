	AlphaCentauriA = Nova Kirbani A is a G-type star about more massive than Kerbol. It is in a binary orbit with Nova Kirbani B.
	AlphaCentauriB = Nova Kirbani B is a K-type star, slightly cooler than Kerbol. It is in a binary orbit with Nova Kirbani A.
	AlphaCentauriBarycenter = Nova Kirbani A and B are binary stars. They do not orbit each other, but they "dance" around their combined center of mass. This point is called a barycenter.
	ProximaCentauri = Proksimus Kirbani, or Nova Kirbani C, is an M-type red dwarf and is the nearest star to Kerbol. The spectral "class" of a star does not represent its size, rather its color and chemical properties.
	Alva = A planet slightly smaller than Kerbin has just transited across Nova Kirbani A. It appears to be just outside the habitable zone, so it could be possible the planet had water.
	Blalo = A planet slightly larger than Kerbin has been discovered orbiting Nova Kirbani A. Due to its proximity to Nova Kirbani A, it might have oceans and maybe even life.
        Ito = A small moon has been discovered alarmingly close to Blalo.
	Leyn = An unremarkable moon roughly the size of Ike has been discovered orbiting Blalo.
	Rav = A small moon has been discovered orbiting Blalo. It appears to have one abnormally massive crater.
	Alar = We have discovered a decent-sized moon in a high orbit of Blalo.
	Mork = A small dot has just transited Nova Kirbani A.
	Lark = We have obtained preliminary evidence that Mork has a small asteroid "moon" in a binary orbit with it.
	Orus = The mathematical predictions were true! Scientists found another planet orbiting around Nova Kirbani A.
	Ile = A tiny moon has been discovered orbiting Orus. That's it.
	Ud = A very small asteroid has been discovered in an irregular orbit around Orus.
	Kaith = We've identified a planet very close to Nova Kirbani B. Based on its proximity, it's likely to be hazardous.
	Cail = A planet has just transited Nova Kirbani B. It is most likely a small rocky body.
	Syro = Our scanners indicate a small planet is just barely within the habitable zone of Nova Kirbani B. It's expected to have a runaway greenhouse atmosphere.
	Tur = We have discovered a small moon around Syro. It appears to have a canyon stretching across its entire surface.
	Setha = A moon of similar size to Minmus has been discovered orbiting Syro. It seems to have an unusually large crater.
	Iro = A Mun-sized planet has just transited Proksimus Kirbani! It is likely to be tidally locked.
	Narath = We just discovered a possible habitable planet around Proksimus Kirbani. The planet is a little larger than Kerbin and probably tidally locked.
	Neid = A small moon has been found orbiting Narath. Good view, at least.
	Sian = Gravitational perturbations in Narath's orbit revealed that the system had another big planet. Seems like we found it!
	Elius = Gravitational perturbations in Sian's orbit revealed that the system had another giant planet. Seems like we found it!
	Irnil = A small moon has been discovered in orbit of Elius. Due to its proximity to the planet, it is likely to be geologically active.
	Nyss = We have found a moon orbiting Elius. Unusually, it appears to be covered in dust. This may be worth investigating.
	Um = A very small asteroid in a very irregular, inclined orbit has been discovered orbiting Elius. It is most likely a captured object.
	BarnardsStar = Kerman's Star is a red dwarf slightly dimmer than Proksimus Kirbani, with about 14 percent of Kerbol's mass.
	Iores = A reasonably large planet has transited Kerman's Star. It appears to have an atmosphere and there are signs of a ring system as well.
	LuhmanBarycenter = The brown dwarves of the Kormann system are binary, and orbit a barycenter.
	LuhmanA = Kormann Kerman has discovered a brown dwarf, surprisingly close to Kerbol. This is a "failed star" with insufficient mass to cause fusion of hydrogen into helium.
	LuhmanB = Kormann Kerman has discovered another brown dwarf, slightly brighter than Kormann A. These stars were located near the galactic plane, so other stars made them harder to see.
	Tide = A planet has just transited Kormann 16A. It appears to be slightly larger than Kerbin, but, given that Kormann 16A is a brown dwarf, it is almost certainly not habitable.
	Vivus = We have discovered a planet around Kormann 16A. It certainly has an atmosphere, and is around the size of Eve.
	Skaron = Our astronomers have discovered a small moon with low gravity orbiting Vivus. Our astronomers are also sure they aren't looking at Eve and Gilly.
	WISE0855-0714 = We're hesitant to call this a "star". We can't even classify it as a brown dwarf. It is essentially a rogue gas giant, several times larger than Jool.
	Wolf359 = Virg 359 is a very small, dim M-type star just massive enough to receive that classification. It has only 9% of Kerbol's mass.
	Lalande21185 = Denalan 21185 is a very bright red dwarf, though it is still too dim to be seen without a telescope. It has 46% of Kerbol's mass.
	SiriusBarycenter = Seirios A and B orbit this barycenter, about 20 AU (or 20 times the distance between Kerbin and Kerbol) apart.
	SiriusA = Seirios A, a white A-type star, is the brightest in Kerbin's skies. It has been observed for thousands of years.
	Anubis = We have identified a large planet in a very close orbit of Seirios A. It seems to have a dense atmosphere.
	Heh = A dwarf planet has transited Seirios A. It appears to have a ring system.
	Kek = A tiny, tiny boulder has been discovered orbiting Heh. 
	IsusBarycenter = Binary planets Isus and Apophis orbit this barycenter.
	Isus = We have identified a potentially habitable world in orbit of Seirios A. Perturbations in its orbit indicate it has a binary companion.
	Apophis = A large planet with a tenuous atmosphere has transited Seirios A. Perturbations in its orbit indicate it has a binary companion.
	Sait = A small moon has been discovered orbiting the Isus-Apophis barycenter.
	Shu = We have identified a very small moon orbiting the barycenter of Isus and Apophis.
	SiriusB = Seirios B is a white dwarf, the remains of a larger star which exhausted all of its fuel. Eventually, many stars, including Kerbol, will decay into one.
	Mau = What appears to be a large asteroid has transited Seirios B. It may be worth visiting.
	Azmodan = A huge planet has transited Seirios A and B. It is most likely a gas or ice giant orbiting their barycenter.
	Esna = We have identified a small moon orbiting Azmodan, a gas giant in the Seirios system. Preliminary data indicates the presence of an unknown mineral.
	Piho = A moon roughly the size of Ike has been discovered in orbit of Azmodan. It seems to have a very thin atmosphere.
	Pandemon = A massive planet with appropriately massive rings has been discovered simultaneously orbiting Seirios A and B.
	Iat = There appears to be a moon orbiting within Pandemon's ring system. Its size is similar to Ike. The view from its surface must be amazing.
	Thmei = We have discovered a moon orbiting Pandemon. Its composition does not match Pandemon's ring system, suggesting it formed further away before moving inward.
	Anur = A small moon has been identified in a distant orbit of Pandemon. There is a notable crater within its northern hemisphere.
	LuytenBarycenter = Laythen 726-8 A and B orbit this barycenter.
	Luyten726-8-A = Laythen 726-8 A is an M-type star known as a flare star, which occasionally undergoes rapid changes in brightness.
	Luyten726-8-B = Laythen 726-8 B, also known as UV Turi, is, like its sibling, a flare star. Other flare stars, such as Proksimus Kirbani, are actually referred to as UV Turi stars.
	Ross248 = Surr 248 is a small flare star like most red dwarves, with roughly 14% of Kerbol's mass. It will actually become the closest star to Kerbol in 80,000 years, at a distance of 3 light-years.
	Ross154 = Surr 154 is an M-type flare star. It has 17% of Kerbol's mass, but only 0.38% of its luminosity.
	EpsilonEridani = Kespilon Kirliani is a K-class star, slightly smaller than Kerbol. It is a relatively young star, less than a billion years old.
	Orin = We have discovered a planet orbiting relatively close to Kespilon Kirilani. It appears to be reasonably large, and is likely to be a warm ice giant.
	Ut = There seems to be a tiny moon with a small discolored area orbiting close to Orin.
	Volos = A Minmus-sized moon with distinct hills has been discovered orbiting Orin.
	Thythe = A massive planet has transited across Kespilon Kirilani. It seems to be within the habitable zone. It is too large to be anything other than a gas giant, but it could have habitable moons.
	Aio = We have discovered a decently large moon orbiting close to Thythe. It is likely to be geologically active.
	Trall = A large moon has been discovered orbiting Thythe. It appears to have an atmosphere, which may be similar to that of Kerbin or Eve.
	Rhan = A very large moon - larger than Duna - has been discovered orbiting Thythe. It may be habitable! Further research is strongly advised.
	Borr = We have discovered a moon in orbit of Thythe. It appears to have an atmosphere of unknown composition, as well as canyons.
	Irve = A moon roughly the size of our Mun has been discovered in high orbit of Thythe. It has few craters.
	Ael = We have discovered a ringed gas giant orbiting Kespilon Kirilani. It may have some interesting moons, or useful resources in its rings.
	Kioh = A tiny, tiny moon, even smaller than Gilly, has been found orbiting Ael, very close to its primary ring.
	Cyll = Our astronomers have identified a moon orbiting between Ael's primary ring and dustier secondary ring. It is likely to have a subsurface ocean due to its proximity to the planet.
	Blud = We have discovered a moon with a thin atmosphere orbiting outside Ael's rings. Its peculiar conditions could allow liquid water to exist on its surface.
	Frigg = We have discovered a moon in a distant orbit around Ael. Ael's gravity is still strong enough to cause tidal forces on it, which could lead to interesting geological properties.
	Tias = Our astronomers have identified a ringed ice giant orbiting far away from Kespilon Kirilani. It may be an interesting place to visit.
	Fen = Interesting. There appears to be a moon in polar orbit of Tias, which may actually take it beyond the boundary of Tias' ring system. The circumstances of its formation should be investigated.
	Tritae = We have identified a cold moon orbiting Tias. It also appears to have a surprisingly dense atmosphere.
	Lacaille9352 = Lecaylle-9532 is a faint red dwarf star 10.74 light years away from Kerbol, with about 48% of its mass.
 	Ross128 = Surr 128 is a red dwarf star orbited by a cloud of dust. It is also a flare star like many other M-types.
	EZ-AquariiBarycenter = The SC Aquell system is held together by a barycenter.
	EZ-AquariiBarycenter-1 = SC Aquell A and C orbit a barycenter, which itself orbits a barycenter.
	EZ-AquariiA = SC Aquell A is a small red dwarf with only 0.11 solar masses (11% of Kerbol's mass). It is the primary star of its system.
	EZ-AquariiB = SC Aquell B is another M-type star, which orbits far from its siblings.
	EZ-AquariiC = SC Aquell C is a red dwarf slightly smaller than its sibling, SC Aquell A, in an incredibly close binary orbit with it.
	61CygBarycenter = 61 Signar A and B, as binary stars, orbit this barycenter.
	61CygniA = 61 Signar A is a K-type star, with 70% of the mass of Kerbol. It orbits 61 Cygni B slowly.
	61CygniB = 61 Signar B is slightly smaller than 61 Signar A. There have been repeated claims of another object in the system, though this is not proven.
	ProcyonBarycenter = Proksion A and B are a binary system, orbiting a common point in space.
	ProcyonA = Proksion A is a bright F-type star, one of the brightest in the skies of Kerbin.
	ProcyonB = Proksion B is a white dwarf, much like Seirios B. It is unusually small, even for a white dwarf.
	EpsilonIndiBarycenter = The Kespilon Yndi ternary star system is held together by a barycenter.
	EpsilonIndiBarycenter-1 = Kespilon Yndi Ba and Bb orbit this barycenter, far from Kespilon Yndi A.
	EpsilonIndiA = Kespilon Yndi A is a K-type star. Even though its mass is lower than Kerbol's, its surface gravity is higher.
	EpsilonIndiBa = Kespilon Yndi Ba is a brown dwarf in a binary orbit with another. It will eventually die out, as it is unable to maintain a fusion reaction.
	EpsilonIndiBb = Kespilon Yndi Bb is an extremely dim, cold brown dwarf in a binary orbit with Kespilon Yndi Ba.
	TauCeti = Cer Turi is a G-type star, like Kerbol. However, it is smaller. It could be a good place to look for extraterrestrial life.
	Sicar = Our astronomers have discovered a planet in a close orbit of Cer Turi. It is likely very hot and uninhabitable.
	Eolus = We have discovered a large planet orbiting Cer Turi. Notably, our observations indicate it is in an irregular orbit.
	Aquel = We have discovered a planet orbiting within the habitable zone of Cer Turi. It may be a small gas planet, or a large atmospheric world.
	Liolan = Our astronomers have discovered a large planet in a distant orbit of Cer Turi. It is probably a gas giant.
	LuytensStar = Laythen's Star, named for astronomer Laythen Kerman, is a red dwarf star, with one quarter of Kerbol's mass. It is currently moving away from Kerbol.
	TeegardensStar = Saaghen's Star is a faint red dwarf star, only recently discovered. It was believed to be closer to Kerbol due to an incorrect measurement.
	Teeb = A planet has just transited Saaghen's Star. We are uncertain if it is rotating or not, meaning it is likely tidally locked.
	Teec = We have discovered a planet in a distant orbit of Saaghen's Star. It is likely to be cold, as it is far from the star.
	KapetynsStar = Kapetyn's Star is a red subdwarf: not a red dwarf, but not a white dwarf. It is incredibly old due to a reduced amount of fuel for its fusion reaction, which is also the reason for its unique classification.
	DENIS-P10481 = DENIS-P is a small, dim red dwarf difficult to observe from Kerbin.
	OTS44 = OTS44 is a small dwarf star surrounded by a massive accretion disk which could develop into a planetary system.
	VanMaanen2 = Van Neeren 2 is a lone white dwarf relatively close to Kerbol, the only one of its kind discovered so far.
	Groombridge1618 = Glowridge 1618 is a K-type star with 67% of Kerbol's mass. It is unknown whether a planetary system orbits it or not.
	Altair = Lataire is a bright A-type star visible to the unaided eye. It rotates incredibly fast, to the point where it is not actually spherical.
	SigmaDraconis = Seta Drakaris is a K-type star, with a mass 85% of Kerbol's. Unfortunately, there is no evidence a planetary system orbits it... yet.
	82GEridani = 82 G. Kirliani is a G-type star slightly smaller than Kerbol. It may be what is known as a population II star, with a lower amount of heavy elements than other stars.
	Gliese581 = Glize 581 is an M-class star. Its brightness can temporarily shift, briefly doubling its luminosity. This is what is known as a variable star.
	Lich = Leethe is a neutron star, the remnants of a supergiant's core after a gravitational collapse. It is also a pulsar, which emits massive jets of electromagnetic radiation from its poles. Not only that, but it spins once every 10 seconds.
	Dragûr = Our astronomers appear to have discovered a planet orbiting the pulsar Leethe. The electromagnetic radiation from Leethe may threaten our spacecraft, but, as a world around an exotic star, exploration may be worth the risk.
        Polter = We have discovered a large planet with a dense atmosphere orbiting around Leethe. It is likely a super-Kerbin, and is unlikely to harbor life.
	Phobor = We have found a planet orbiting Leethe. It appears to be massive, and is likely dense based on gravitational perturbations in Polter's orbit. It also appears to have a thin atmosphere.
	Bellatrix = Sorionix is a massive B-type blue star. It is a relatively young star, but will only last for a few million more years.
	Formalhaut = Autarsis is an A-type star which appears to be surrounded by disks of dust. It could also host a planetary system.
	3Orionis = Pi 3 Areucis is a white star, slightly smaller and dimmer than Kerbol. It is also likely to be a population II star, which has a lower amount of heavy elements than others.
	Atlas = A large planet has been discovered orbiting Pi 3 Areucis. It appears to have rings and an atmosphere. It could be an Eve-like world, a super-Kerbin, or a gas giant.
	61Virginis = 61 Rigilis, like Kerbol, is a G-type star. It also may host a planetary system, which could bear life.
	DeltaEridani = Alto Kirliani is an old star, which appears to be expanding and becoming a red giant, much like Kerbol will become. Studying it could provide insight into our sun's future.
	Arcturus = Carvanis is a red giant, a main-sequence star which has depleted the hydrogen in its core. It is older than Kerbin, and much brighter than Kerbol (well, if you were close to it).
	Trappist1 = Tarsis-1 is an ultracool red dwarf, far from Kerbol, which could last for trillions of years.
	Belph = We have identified a planet orbiting close to Tarsis-1. It has an atmosphere, and is likely to be very hot.
	Ceph = A planet with a dense atmosphere has been discovered orbiting Tarsis-1. We are unable to gather any information about its surface, assuming it has one.
	Deian = We have identified a planet orbiting Tarsis-1. It has a dense atmosphere, but is within the habitable zone, and may support life, to some extent.
	Eios = Our astronomers have discovered a planet within Tarsis-1's habitable zone. It may be somewhat similar to Kerbin and should definitely be investigated.
	Fihlo = We have identified a planet within Tarsis-1's habitable zone. It appears to have a very thin atmosphere similar to that of Duna, with a higher gravity.
	Gerio = A planet has been identified orbiting Tarsis-1, within the outer region of its habitable zone. Unfortunately, it does not appear to be that habitable.
	Hylas = We have identified a planet orbiting far from Tarsis-1. It is likely to be very cold and may be subject to tidal forces from Tarsis-1.
	SgrA = We have conclusively determined that the radio source Kax A* is, in fact, a supermassive black hole. Not even light can escape, once it passes beyond the event horizon. It is certainly worth exploring.
	TheAll = Implausibly, something appears to be orbiting around Kax A*. We have no idea what it is - or any ideas what it could be. Its properties do not match those of any known celestial body.
	PolarisBarycenter = The binary stars Arceus Minor Aa and Ab orbit this point.
	PolarisBarycenter-1 = Arceus Minor B orbits the binary objects of Arceus Minor A at this point.
	PolarisAa = Arceus Minor Aa is a yellow supergiant which appears directly above Kerbin's north pole. The other stars appear to revolve around it.
	PolarisAb = Arceus Minor Ab may be bright, but its companion is brighter. This made it very difficult for astronomers to discover.
	PolarisB = Arceus Minor B is a bright F-type star in a binary orbit with two other bright stars.
	V1400CentauriA = V1400 Kirbani is a young K-type star far away from Kerbol. It may be a good idea to keep an eye on it.
	V1400CentauriB = There appears to be another object orbiting V1400 Kirbani - surrounded by a massive protoplanetary disc! It would very likely be a good place to set up mining operations.
	Betelgeuse = Beregus is a red supergiant, and is appropriately bright. It has been known to dim, suggesting it is close to going supernova. It is a priority to visit it before it does.
	Infurus = There appears to be a planet somehow orbiting the supergiant star Beregus. It is almost certainly inhospitable and incredibly hot.
